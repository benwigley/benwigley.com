    <h2>What is Beyond Quantum Healing?</h2>

    <p>Beyond Quantum Healing (BQH) is a hypnosis modality that takes a client to visit and learn from past, present, parellel, or future lives. Clients come to the session with a list of questions they would like answered by the higher part of their being (higher self, super consciousness, etc) that can come through in these deep states of trance hypnosis when the client is in the Theta state.</p>

    <p>If you are new to BQH or QHHT, then I suggest you do your research before booking a session, as it is a very specific healing modality. Here are some recommenations of videos to check out to see if it's right for you:</p>

    <h3>What BQH is not</h3>

    <p>
      BQH Hypnosis is not "dreaming", or "going to sleep". Clients are fully aware of what is going on, and will almost always remember everything that has heppened in a session. Hypnosis is really a deep form of "daydreaming", and allows you to view past experiences/lives similar to how you would replay a past experience in a daydream.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is up to you as the client whether you wish to belive you made these experiences up or if they are real, based on
      your belief system and the experience you have.
    </p>

    <br />
    <h3>All Hypnosis is Self-Hypnosis</h3>
    <p>
      No one can force hypnosis on you if you are not willing to go deep into relaxation and allow yourself to let go of the judgement and expextation you have around visualisation. For this reason I recommend all prostective clients begin practicing visualisation exersises prior to booking your session. This will help to train and prepare the mind for this type explorative hypnosis. Having a strong meditation practice is also beneficial, although it is not required.
    </p>
    <p>
      Don't worry if you don't feel like you are able to be hypnotised. The ability to be hypnotised is a skill just like any other. The more you practive visualiation, and the times you go under hypnosis, the easier it becomes. To practice; simply look at an object, close your eyes and bring that object to mind. See how long you can concentrate on that object without loosing focus. See it in as much detail as you can. Do this a few times a day as you remember and you will start to strengthen your "visualization muscle".</p>
